# My GitHub account was made on github.com with my Wake Tech email address.

# I created and cloned this repositry which only contains comments. The purpose was to test that I can create and edit GitHub repositries for future assignments.

# The steps I took were: 
# 1. I signed up for an account on github.com. 
# 2. I clicked "New"
# 3. I entered "emmak8j.github.io" under "Repository name"
# 4. I selected "Add a README file"
# 5. I clicked "Create repository"
# 6. I downloaded GitHub desktop. 
# 7. I logged in to GitHub desktop with my github.com account.
# 8. I clicked "Clone a repositry from the internet"
# 9. I selected my "emmak8j.github.io repositry"
# 10. I selected a location on my hard drive to save it to (Documents -> My school folder -> My folder for this course -> A GitHub folder -> "emmak8j.github.io" folder -> This file )

# Now, I am accessing the file by clicking on it in my File Explorer and selecting the Notepad app to edit. I will save this file, open GitHub desktop, commit the changes to main, and push the changes to origin. 

# I will submit the github repository URL with screenshots.
